There are many biological and psychological factors. I\u2019ve been abused by my otherwise lovely mother by her putting me on diets starting at age 8. I was a normal girl then, not overweight at all. She pestered me, pleaded with me, bribed me, shamed me, threatened me, over and over till only recently (I\u2019m 40) to lose weight.

It\u2019s simply teaching people who find themselves in that situation to love themselves for who they are no matter what their progress will be. Because it is a tough slog, my friend. I would not wish it on anyone. And the only way I\u2019m ever able to be successful is when I know that I am worthy of love and that starts with loving myself.

Not just people who do not smoke now, or haven't smoked for more than ten years, but never smoked.  In older populations, when smoking was more socially acceptable,  that is going to eliminate a sizable number of people, and perhaps skew the population towards those who have chosen a very different lifestyle.  When you go to the appendix, you can see that applying the never smoked standard significantly shifts the risk ratios, while using the non-smoker standard barely does anything.  Since the risk for smoking related diseases goes down significantly when you quit, that makes it a bit suspicious that the effect you are seeing is a population bias.\n\n\nThen, no one with a chronic disease.  OK, I get that people with chronic diseaes are more likely to die.  But by excluding them, you are basically saying that these people are *protected* by overweight.  Sure, if you are underweight, and have a disease, you are probably close to death.  But what is the rational for excluding them from the normal and overweight population?  Isnt the theory that overweight exacerbates chronic disease? Shouldn't that mean that those who are overweight and diseased die more rapidly than normal weight with the same condition? But they don't. So they are excluded. But even with that exclusion, overweight group is not at higher risk of death.\n\n\nSo then the authors further constrain to those who don't die within five years of the start of the study.  They have to do this to get their desired result.  So what are we supposed to conclude from this? That if you don't want to die in the next five years, you should put on some weight?",

They also had to eliminate anyone with a known chronic condition, or anyone who died within five years.  So, if you just take someone today, without chronic disease, and who never smoked, an overweight person has a lower risk than the normal weight person.  That only goes away if you eliminate anyone who dies in the next five years.  To me, not very convincing from a public health standpoint.\n\n\nClearly being very fat is risky.

While it may be a standard methodology, those in the field seem to recognize its inherent bias. His paper nicely shows that the stable weight people in every category have better risk ratios than those who have lost weight.  So the issue with sick people losing weight, either because they are sick, or in an attempt to improve their health exists in every weight category.  So super-obese become obese, obese become overweight, overweight become normal and so on.  When you look at the stable normal versus the stable overweight, there is a non-significant difference in risk ratio.  Even stable obese class I is barely higher considering the confidence interval.  Check out the risks of class II obese that are now normal! Dang. This is clearly a superior methodology to that in the Lancet, though the numbers are so small. While it does not show a protective effect of overweight, it also does not suggest significant health risks to being overweight.\n\n\nI hope the fat acceptance folk don't latch on to that to prove losing weight is dangerous! Its probably confounded by people in bad health making the choice to lose weight. It would be great to do a study where they also asked if any health concerns prompted weight loss.",

It shows a small increase in risk for overweight and a moderate increase for Class I obese that is consistent with what Stokes' study suggests.\n\nAs far as proving that weight loss is dangerous, the vast majority of weight loss in later life is not voluntary.

If they work less then they have more time to do things, travel, new activities, and they grow as a person, which could lead to a self-awakening and self discovery.\n\nIf they work more/harder though, maybe they just don't have the time to munch all day and when they get home they go straight to bed. Maybe when people who are becoming obese or are obese say they work hard, they're misjudging the actually level of exertion they're putting into their work, especially if they have the opportunity to munch away all while working. \n\nPersonally I have a low income and even if I worked 24 hours straight, I'm not working \"hard\". I'm hardly working but for a long time. I DO have time to munch and graze all day, and when I get home I am not tired because I didn't exert myself so I stay up and munch some more. \n\nIsn't it also true that more strenuous careers pay more? Carpenters and Laborers pay at least $50k a year, (while an 80 hour weekly McDonald's career pays maybe $35-35k).

        "body": "This study reports on observations in a Swiss cohort. It was shown that there are distinct spatial distributions and the authors find that their models including many variables still doesn't explain all the results and think that urbanism may be in cause.\n\nMy own arguably educated guess would be that there are important interaction terms that they didn't input, and that the inclusion of ethnic data is incomplete given that they just distinguish \"caucasian\" versus anything else. Ethnic data would correct roughly for genetics but also for cultural aspects. This area has a very diverse population including Turkish, Albanian, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian populations, as well as Swiss or French people. I live here and it's very obvious that there are social clusters by origin that are very important, with for example dining centers where people from Portuguese or Turkish origins congregate on the weekend, or given that people from Albanian origins who speak the same language tend to hang out together.\n\nI would also think that there's an important aspect of positive feedbacks happening within all these social groups, whereby it is known that the larger your friends and acquaintances, the larger you tend to be.\n\nThe supposition that urbanism is in cause is not however that bad, given that there are indeed more walkable areas among richer places. However, poorer people also tend to take public transportation more and not live within residential areas that are not walkable, so I'm curious whether this is that important a factor. Adding to that the fact that in CICO, CI is more important than CO, and my own (admittedly anecdotal) observation of the people within the lower income areas (where I have lived and raised kids in the past 6.5 years) is that people with lower incomes and not a Swiss or French culture tend to give crappy diets to their kids and the kids are fat as a result, and fat parents have fatter children. This is what I see within my kid's friends, who are all in public daycare and therefore get similar levels of activity and the same meals during the day.\n\nAnyway, I'm curious to see these results explored some more because I wouldn't think urban environment has that important a role to play compared to education and food culture, and it seems more probable to me that there's a lacking model somewhere in interaction terms and feedbacks.",
