He was hospitalized for a few days and put on blood thinners for the foreseeable future. The dude was like 25 at the time but still ate and drank like he was in college. Just absolutely does NOT take care of himself and thinks he's invincible. \n\nHis girlfriend, a HUGE alcoholic and enabler, would never hear of him cleaning up his act because she likes drinking too much. I genuinely can't remember the last time I saw a picture of her (even selfies) where she isn't holding some form of alcohol. It's actually really embarrassing because she's always holding it in a way to ensure it's presented for the world to see, and she's usually the only one in her many group photos who's holding a drink. Even the day she posted pics moving into her new apartment, she's hanging out on the back of the u-haul truck and strategically holding a drink. \n\nSo back to the dude. My boyfriend was visiting him in the hospital and telling him how serious a blood clot in your lung can be. He told him he really needs to start taking care of himself, starting with curbing his drinking. He was immediately cut off by the girlfriend who says, 'oh, no no no! He can still drink! It's fine!'\n\nIt's infuriating how people can be with these things.",

You put being fat on the same list of unacceptable behaviors as \"pedophiles and their sick fantasy\" and other callous things that directly hurt others.\n\nA lot of fat people got that way from emotional addiction to food. In fact, a shocking number of *My 600-Pound Life* stars were abused in childhood and turned to overeating early on for comfort and relief. Many others are just genuinely unaware of how much they're overeating (sadly too easy in this modern food-saturated environment!), hence the misinformed \"slow metabolism\" and \"it's my genetics\" claims.\n\nIn either case, it's clear why they'd be hurt at being called lazy and gluttonous. We know they do have agency over their situation, but for them, it can be really, really hard not to feel helpless. More often than you'd think, they too know they're not \"being the best version of themselves,\" experiencing the difficulties of their weight firsthand.\n\nHere on this sub, we don't tend to compare obesity to evil. We compare it to any other kind of dysfunctional behavioral addiction, such as alcoholism. Surely you wouldn't tell an alcoholic simply to stop making excuses and choose to be the best version of themselves. It's not all about a lack of virtue.",

While losing weight by not eating enough due to mental issues is not healthy, I\u2019m still overweight, literally a pound away from obese and losing weight is not a major issue(they were more worried about the weight loss itself than the underlying issues).

Let's ignore that for just a moment and focus on being healthy with your current situation. Don't wait to magically get skinny, go out and exercise, start eating healthy. You don't have to give up on being healthy and happy just because you're fat now. Focus on doing the healthy things, and don't worry about what you look like or how much you weigh if that prevents you from doing something.\" \n\nAnd then people blew it out of proportion, and said, \"Oh so you mean being fat is okay?\" And then finally, \"Being fat is *great*!\" This is the same with every part of culture, where someone will say, \"maybe cut down on carbs a little\" and then you have these crazy paleo cults, or \"it might be a good idea to cook your own food and not buy packaged food all the time\" becomes some kind of weird health food cult where all chemicals are bad.\n\nI think it might be because, basically, some people like dogma but where they would have just turned to religion at some point in time, it's no longer as attractive as an option. So instead you adopt your own crazy dogma, one of which is \"all kinds of being fat is great\" instead of \"it's great to love yourself for who you are, but please try to be healthy\".\n\nI say this as someone who is realizing he is just on the cusp of being overweight according to BMI (5'9\", nearly 170lbs) and freaking out about it.

You should feel bad because you are LITERALLY complaining about the fact that you have a complete lack of self-control and have atrocious physique as a result.  And you shouldn't expect me to appreciate that, because it actually repulses me, just like eating a salad (without loads of bleu cheese, ranch, and bacon) repulse you. Oh, and you're shaving on average 6.5 - 14 years off of your life.\n\nAnd let's not forget how much your eventual diabetes and CHF/multiple MIs will cost the health care system, because of COURSE you won't be insured either.\n\nIf you want to be a fat slob and are happy with it (you shouldn't be), that's fine by me. But I take issue with you aggressively trying to make me accept your deleterious lifestyle when I work hard and exercise self control to maintain healthy.\n\nI gained 30 pounds in college, putting me at overweight. After college, instead of trying to make people accept my body image, I went to the gym almost every day and stopped eating like a whale. And I lost 40 pounds and feel great, but am keeping it up.\n\nThere is NO reason to have such an unhealthy physique. Thyroid problems only go so far. They won't make you gain phantom weight, just fucking lower your caloric intake. Maybe if you're bedridden because you're paralyzed or something, that I can understand. It's rather hard to burn off calories at that point.\n\nAnd complaining about time restraints for exercise and how inconvenient healthy food is? I'm in medical school. I had a full time job beforehand. Making your own food is CHEAPER and might take on average 5-10 minutes a day, more if you are preparing an actual dinner or so. And I can fit an hour+ of exercise into every day while maintaining good standing in medical school. Time restraints are no excuse.",

        "body": ">And the majority of FAs seem to be white women, how do they reconcile the 'intersectionality' given that the majority of people with not enough to eat are PoC?\n\nI don't see how that's true though. Obesity is strongly correlated with poverty in the US. And while it affects all Americans in poverty, black Americans tend to be the most heavily affected due to wealth disparity. \n\nIn the US, being poor = being fat. We live in an overworked, sedentary, consumerist capitalist society that shovels empty calories into our mouths in the guise of actual nutrition. The sugar industry and food inc are major culprits as well and they target the poor and middle class. Those healthy/skinny majorities in Europe and Asia? They aren't thinner because they know more about nutrition, but because their structural conditions don't send them on a constant sloped path to empty weight gain. \n\nBasically I think being fat in America is a byproduct of larger oppression, as well as a kind of oppression in itself. Would we shame someone for being poor? No, absolutely not. But we also wouldn't pretend that it's not a problem to be solved together, with everyone's support. I am not a fan of the anti-fat bullying tendencies that reddit can sometimes slip into, but it is true that to avoid being fat in America, it's more extra work. In a sense it's the task of resisting all the corporate mind-games that we are raised in from birth, and which we cooperate with unthinkingly, to the point where we feel so trapped that people will *identify* as being fat. I mean, just just think about it philosophically: fat is part of their *being*, when it's a transitory physical state. \n\nAnyways we live in a society that's saturated with excess and desire, little of which is authentically nourishing. Counterintuitively, in the US, that saturation isn't a privilege but the very method of our exploitation. Some people do just like to eat a lot though but as a general public policy concern it's based in economics.",

Vegetable oil is also cheaper now, so instead of using a little oil, people can now use a lot of oil.\n\nMicronutrient deficiencies are huge in places where obesity is becoming pandemic.

This is just some sad person that has nothing better to do. They're probably not even in great shape, but they hate one fat person... Maybe more, but they really just hate themselves for not being able to cope with other people being able to live their life on their own. These fat hate people just want to be mad or have some sort of stress in their life at all times, they're people that you can cross and they'll hate you and treat you like shit (for something that doesn't even effect them); these fat hate types of people don't care for you unconditionally and that's why this fat hate movement is fueled by asshats and jackoffs.  \n\nEdit: fok naillers",

Especially when many \"people of color\" aren't related to the transatlantic slavery to and in america, and most have not the slightest idea of slavery... in fact many of those I talked to thought that the \"Caucasian's\" invented the slave trade, which started and ended with them!

The ones who take the biscuits at coffee break and then moan about how their diet doesn't work. the ones who tell me how 'lucky' I am to be slim and wear what I want (they know I calorie count and work out most days) the ones who complain their SOs don't find them attractive any more, and then go out with the girls and eat and drink until they're sick. 'In my experience' is a synonym for anecdote and I wasn't claiming otherwise. Occasional 'fierce curves' fb posts aside, all I hear from the fat women I know is how much they hate their fat and wish they were slimmer. Genuinely I don't personally know any fat women who say they are happy with their weight.\n\nRe: ' majority' it would be very tiring, and dysfunctional, to hate 70% of the people around you, just for one characteristic. I don't care whether you believe me or not, that's your choice. I do dislike FA/HAES promoters on the Internet (never met any IRL) because they are liars, not because they are fat.",

Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist. Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high. Is such the fast that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself? Is it to bow down his head like a reed, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord? \u201cIs not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? **Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh**?\u201d\n(Isaiah 56:3-7)",

The ones I work with, my friends, my neighbours, my relatives and the ones I see on TV/media here in the UK.\n\nIn the UK, 64% of people are obese or overweight, but it sounds like we're only talking about obese people, which is a smaller number. Let's just give you the benefit of the doubt here and say an even 50% of UK citizens are obese.\n\nWe're talking specifically about women, and while I believe women have a higher rate of obesity than men, they're fairly similar, so I'm just going to stick with 50%.\n\nSo, when you say *loads* of fat white women, I'm asking you, specifically, how many? If there are 40 women in your life, that means there would be about 20 obese women, which means you would have had to have gotten close enough to that many people to be able to discern that they hate themselves.\n\nAgain, surely you can see why I think you're lying to me.\n\n>The ones who take the biscuits at coffee break and then moan about how their diet doesn't work.\n\nI'll bet you've literally never heard a single person say their diet doesn't work while eating cookies, and if you actually bothered to listen to what they had to say (rather than hate them for being fat, which I am accusing you of), you'd find what they're actually saying is that dieting is a very slow, very difficult process that was making them miserable, and they find it incredibly difficult to stick to.\n\n>the ones who tell me how 'lucky' I am to be slim and wear what I want (they know I calorie count and work out most days)\n\nWhat they mean is that the affects of dieting (which most slim people don't do; they simply aren't as hungry, don't enjoy food as much, don't hate exercise as much, etc) don't affect everyone in the same way.\n\n> 'In my experience' is a synonym for anecdote and I wasn't claiming otherwise. \n\nI'm aware of that. I suspect you're exaggerating, misunderstanding, and/or lying, which is a common tactic among FPHers.\n\n>all I hear from the fat women I know is how much they hate their fat and wish they were slimmer. Genuinely I don't personally know any fat women who say they are happy with their weight.\n\nThis is not in dispute. I asked why this would be? And yes, attractiveness is part of it, and feeling better is another part. But if you ever care to listen to these women and what they have to say, you might consider asking if they feel disliked in general *because* they're fat.\n\nAnd they are. And that's awful. And that's what my initial comment was about.\n\n>Re: ' majority' it would be very tiring, and dysfunctional, to hate 70% of the people around you, just for one characteristic.\n\nAnd yet it happens all the time.\n\n>I do dislike FA/HAES promoters on the Internet (never met any IRL) because they are liars, not because they are fat.\n\nAnd yet you don't seem to care about the amount of people that legitimately hate fat people (do you think \"fat\" and \"1 kilo overweight\" are synonymous?)\n\nYou can respond if you like. I'm not actually interested in having this conversation with you. I've never met an FPH that was interested in honest discussion, nor one that was open to having his or her mind changed. I likely won't be taking the time to read your response.",

If you're over 23 and make less than $40k or if you've ever been on public assistance, you're basically retarded. In your twenties and still living off your parents? Pathetic. There are far too many resources to help you find a job and educate yourself about financial planning. There is no excuse for being poor. Poor people are lazy greedy parasites. They leech off my taxes and trash up the scenery. I'm tired of having to look at them. Like you OP, I do everything I can to make their lives worse pushing them ever closer to suicide.\n\nThat being said, nobody wants to be fat. Overeating usually starts as a result of something else, like being bullied, or going through some childhood trauma, or having parents who shovel food into your mouth. Obesity isn't a curse I would wish on my worst enemy. Thank you for my daily reminder that I am a piece of shit.\n\nWhat's that you say? I can change and it's all a choice? Sure is. You're right. Much like religion, smoking, and other real addictions. Overeating is the toughest habit to kick. Fat people are constantly going through phases of self hatred and dieting, followed by more self hatred and dieting. We've spent our whole lives trying to lose the weight, for ourselves and also so we won't be bullied by people like you anymore. A few fat people are now sticking up for themselves and you can't make fun of them fast enough. Good for you.\n\nYou are just as fucked up as any fat person but in ways that aren't outwardly visible. Lucky you.\n\nEdit* I don't hate poor people. I was showing that the reasons you use to hate fat people are also reasons people give for hating poor people.

They can't seem to grasp that an unbathed person in stinky clothes can't fly across town, ace an interview, and then make it to work on time every day to work on an empty stomach.\n\nFat people, in general, don't have that kind of privilege.

They are so oblivious of the comfortable existence they enjoy that they actually believe small seats at stadiums and \"not everyone is attracted to me\" are unbearable human rights violations. They have such little concept of what being hungry - of having food insecurity - is like that they think a life without their current caloric intake would be \"starvation.\" And their lives are so sedentary and their lifestyle so easily-accommodated by modern comforts that they actually think a large size is healthy and preferable.",

They can be upset about having limited clothing options but the beauty of being overweight vs. being an amputee is that you can lose the weight, you can't regenerate your arm.

Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'. There is always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you.\u201d\n\n- George Orwell",

In addition to that you can actually lose weight on the dollar menu. Get one mcdouble, a mini fruit and yogurt parfait, and a side salad. Use half a pack of dressing on the salad. That meal is under 600 calories which is less than a whopper has and cheaper.

But 350 calories worth of cooked vegetables is going to be a TON of food and good luck finishing all of that. That's why, while true that 1 calorie = 1 calorie and 'you can eat anything and lose weight as long you count calories,' food choices can definitely matter because no one will stick to an eating plan if they feel constantly hungry.

        "body": ">Roy Baumeister and his colleagues proposed a model that relates self-control to a muscle, which can become both strengthened and fatigued. Initial use of the \u201cmuscle\u201d of self-control will cause a decrease in strength, or ego depletion, for subsequent tasks. Various experimental findings support this muscle model of self-control and ego depletion.[2]\n\n>A key experiment by Roy Baumeister, Ellen Bratslavsky, Mark Muraven and Dianne Tice in 1998, demonstrated some of the first evidence that ego depletion has effects in many diverse contexts or situations.[1] They showed that people who initially resisted the temptation of chocolates were subsequently less able to persist on a difficult and frustrating puzzle task. They attributed this effect to ego depletion, which resulted from the prior resisting of a tempting treat. Additionally, it was demonstrated that when people voluntarily gave a speech that included beliefs contrary to their own, they were also less able to persist on the difficult puzzle, indicating a state of ego depletion. Interestingly, this effect was not nearly as strong when individuals were not given a choice and were \"forced\" to write a counter-attitudinal speech. Thus, it is believed that both the act of choice and counter-attitudinal behaviors draw upon the same pool of limited resources. While giving a counter-attitudinal speech is expected to produce ego depletion, introducing the element of choice further increases the level of experienced depletion. These findings demonstrated the effects of ego depletion in differential situations and emphasized that ego depletion is not context specific. This experiment was critical in that the researchers synthesized ideas proposed by prior studies that had suggested evidence for a strength model of willpower. With this study, Baumeister and his colleagues therefore provided the first direct experimental evidence of ego depletion, and initiated research interest on the subject.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion\n\nAlso relevant, for dieters:\n\n>An experiment performed by Kathleen Vohs and Todd Heatherton demonstrated how ego depletion is particularly relevant when considering chronic dieters compared to non-dieters.[18] Chronic dieters constantly work at resisting their cravings and limiting their food intake. **Vohs and Heatherton showed that the task of regulating food intake could be undermined in the face of tempting snacks, especially when the individual was experiencing a state of ego depletion.** Both dieters and non-dieters attempted to suppress their emotional responses while watching a movie. Afterwards, participants were required to consume ice cream in order to engage in a taste-test. The major finding was that dieters who suppressed their emotional responses to the movie experienced more ego depletion than those who were not required to suppress their emotions. Additionally, those individuals subsequently ate much more ice cream in the taste-testing task. Non-dieters did not show the same self-regulatory failures as dieters in these tasks. Therefore, it seems that the act of dieting itself is a form of resource expenditure. Dieters spend so much energy trying to limit their food intake, but these efforts are likely to be undermined when faced with overwhelming temptation.",

This event is known as the Looney toss. There are no lap dances in Calgary, only stage shows. Strippers must hustle as much cash onstage as possible. Since strippers must remain three feet away from customers, the hustle is less intimate and more \u2026 strange. For those unfamiliar with Canadian currency, a Looney is a golden Canadian dollar coin. During the Looney toss, Canadian strippers get completely naked and stick a single Looney to their skin with moisture (saliva), typically on an interesting spot like on a boob, or a butt cheek or near the vagina. Customers must then toss Loonies at that stationary Looney to try and knock it off the stripper. People are flinging metal objects at these strippers who are working way too hard, in my opinion. Afterwards, strippers take a magnet and pick up all the Loonies and then get off the stage...\n\n^[Source](http://lasvegasweekly.com/blogs/stripped/2008/nov/13/canaday-stripper-rules-are-decidedly-loony/)",

It was a horrible cycle, and there was nothing you could really do when she was in it. If you told her she looked fine, and amazing, how sexy she was she'd take it as pandering and pitiful, so you kinda just had to roll with it.

The wikipedia article you linked (rofl, btw) has one god damn sentence defining lie by omission and you either didn't read it or fundamentally don't understand the core concept. This is absurd. You're also assuming there is a reality in which the circumstances are so different that this hypothetical rejection wouldn't happen because of arbitrary criteria you chose precisely because it can be changed or improved upon. The real world is almost never this simple, and the reasons why we like or dislike people are often far more complex than one alterable physical trait that would completely turn disinterest into genuine interest. In the end, unless you're being specifically asked about why you believe you reject another person's advances due to disinterest or unattraction, you're better off giving a simple answer. I've never heard, experienced, nor encountered a situation where someone admitted \"well, if only her tits were a C cup instead of an A cup I'd date her\" and then the woman goes out and does it and the man totally changes his mind and they live happily ever after. The real world is infinitely more complex than some hypothetical bullshit stemming from insecure rationalizations over why individual quests for romance happen to not succeed for you or whoever.\n\nTLDR: \"I'm not interested\", \"I don't feel the same about you\", and \"You're not my type\" are not lies by omission. If you want insult-free retorts with \"substance\", maybe you should be somewhere in the fucking realm of having a valid point that isn't torn to shreds by even a low effort reading of a wikipedia link you yourself provided.\n\n> By not specifying that there is a condition in which she may get that date he is lying by omission. The lie is that there is no hope, there is nothing she can do.\n\nThat's not a lie either. Often there is legitimately no circumstance that the person who is doing to rejecting can imagine where they can guarantee the reciprocation of romantic feelings if any number of arbitrary conditions are met. Even if the person who is doing the rejecting could conceive of conditions where they might be able to reciprocate romantic interest, those conditions might fall outside the realm of reasonably possible to meet (i.e. \"If you weren't you, I'd like you\"). If anything is a lie it's telling the person you rejected that they might be able to win you over if they do this or that when you yourself either know that isn't possible or aren't even certain that it's the truth. Telling someone you'd consider dating them if they dropped 20 pounds is practically a fantasy scenario, and is more likely merely a cruel insult that might as well be interpreted as \"I find you fat and gross and there's a snowball's chance in hell I'd ever be interested in you even if you did drop the weight.\" And, let's just imagine that they were being totally sincere: what person with any self worth would be interested in a person that meticulously shallow and cunty?",

I suspect a lot of people who are \"healthy\" eat like shit and either just move around a lot due to circumstance (happening to like playing a particularly active sport, having an active job, etc.) or don't move around a lot but just don't get fat anyways. I think it's just that an increasing percentage of people aren't just eating unhealthy and not exercising enough but are eating REALLY unhealthy and are sedentary and get overweight, which then makes it harder to be active, stresses them into eating more garbage, etc.\n\nYes, I'm a fat ass - go ahead and hate me for it, but just making an observation. I've never known a single person in my life that I would consider eats well and has always exercised regularly other than as mentioned, exercising more due to circumstance than anything.\n\nEdit: To explain on the sport as a circumstance, someone could like bowling, darts, video games, knitting, etc. which simply isn't something that's active, while someone could grow up liking football, baseball, soccer or another active sport and just from that end up being at a healthy weight and body composition even if they eat like shit simply because they get enough activity - and not because they're seeking to \"work out and stay in shape\" but simply because they happen to enjoy something that is active.",

It is compounded by a high carb diet, because carbs stimulate insulin secretion. So that leads to a cycle in which it becomes difficult for the pancreas to \"keep up\", and eventually it can just say \"screw it\" and quit secreting insulin reliably at all.\n\nThe fact that the ADA ridiculed any recommendation of a low-carb diet for T2 diabetics for so long makes me wonder whether they weren't actually trying to sell more meds on behalf of their big pharma sponsors instead of trying to cure the disease.",

If you look a r/fatlogic long enough, you'll see how often people actually *deny* that good lifestyle choices are worth following, they'll say BMI is completely useless, and they'll even argue that the basic laws of thermodynamics don't apply to the human body, or at least, their own bodies. The logical contortions can be amazing. You most likely will hear some of the same stuff in your own social circle, if you ask.\n\nNot only do most people not follow the strictures of \"just eating less and exercising more\", they refuse to even accept the basic premise, regardless of how much evidence is out there.",

But if your blood sugars is 800 and you're eating a salad while walking....., I'm that's not gonna cut it. \n\nYes, diagnosing the disease at the pre-diabetes stage is ideal, but this gets missed frequently as well as ignored,so it's common for sugars to reach 400-500  when ACTION is needed. When someone's sugars are 400 or 500, they don't just start eating better and exercise. They feel like shit until they take medication to bring it lower enough to feel good in order to take care of themselves. This works...a lot of times.... But for many, where diabetes is paired with depression, it is not.... And continues a downward spiral of poor self care behaviors. \n\nIn summary  yes, diabetes can sometimes be reversible but this is a fucking disease in multiple levels (physiological, mental, physical) and if there was a fucking cure then there's be no diabetes. Just like there's no fucking cure for cancer. People need to quit talking about the cure and start helping those with diabetes NOW.  be supportive, not judgmental. And telling someone that they will lose their feet is shitty. This tactic may help sometimes....but it's possible to have diabetes the rest of your life with no complications. \n\nSorry for typos. This was more of a rant towards this entire thread. \n\nAlso like to add that diabetes is reversable, NOT A CURE,  but if you go back to poor habits it comes back again.

I'm just here with the counter argument with all due respect.\n\nI'm on the fence of \"accept the diabetes as it is genetic and lifelong, you can't get rid of it, but embrace it and live healthier and smarter.\" From my perspective and from those I have dealt with (I agree, some need more of an aggressive tactic), there needs to be a commonality of NOT being afraid, otherwise they will always be in anger and denial of the disease and abuse their health. Being diagnosed with a disease is like a death sentence, and PLENTY of people I've met with diabetes go through long periods of denial. \"I feel fine, I'm haven't lost a limb yet, I've got plenty of time.\" \"Oh I need to lose weight? I'll lose weight later when I have time.\"\n\nCANCER and diabetes are so similar in their risk factors. But cancer is easily \"curable\" although it's more of a remission, just like diabetes. Both equals death sentence. But if someone told me that I have cancer, typically it's: , I need to take care of it NOW, diabetes, LATER. This bothers me so much. We've instilled so much fear and shame into diabetes that it pushes people away. With cancer, there's so much more support groups and acceptance and treatment is immediate.\n\nUltimately I'm not talking about treating diabetes. The whole reversible lingo just needs to disappear in my opinion. I'm just tired of how we shame diabetes into this thing where it's 100% modifiable but it won't be forever for many. Weird example, but just like Tom Hanks, he admitted he's not going to weigh like he did when he was young so he accepted his diabetes and likely focused on controlling his sugars, NOT getting rid of it.",

Throw kids, family drama, relationships, and sometimes even emotional disorders on top of that and it's no big surprise that people have trouble losing weight or that there's a correlation between health and income.

When you are fat adapted and not on carbs, you no longer get a carb crash from running out of energy from carbs, you just go from burning fat to burning body fat. It is a much easier transition.\n\nSo, yes. You're totally right. It is all about calories in and calories out.

The most resent meta analysis (analysis of all pertinent studies) from last year could find no relationship between the two. (found in the annals of internal medicine, sorry I'm on my phone).\n\nIt is also noteworthy that saturated fats raise HDL, which is protective against heart disease. \n\nAlso, the evidence is so bad for LDL level targets that they are no longer used in the newest guidelines to prevent heart disease in the united states. A lot of old timer doctors still use the goals (like keeping your LDL under 100), but they are no longer the standard of care in this country. \n\n",
